We immerse ourselves in the web everyday. Let’s face it-- not all of it is pretty. So we take special notice when a website is well-built and beautifully designed. Some of us love the use of iconography. Some enjoy skillful illustration. And some of us just enjoy an easy to understand, and use, interface. 

Take a look at our picks for the best designed websites of the moment. 


<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/96/mapbox.jpg" alt="Web design picks: Mapbox" /></div>

## Mapbox

**Team member**: John Koht  
**URL**: <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">mapbox.com</a>

**What makes me love the design:**  
Mapbox is a really clean website with a lot of information. It strikes a nice balance between application UI screenshots, illustrations, and iconography. I’m a big fan of the videos that show off features of the product that are hard to communicate or simply illustrate.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/99/cool-hunting.jpg" alt="Web design picks: Cool Hunting" /></div>

## CoolHunting

**Team member**: Ian Steele  
**URL**: <a href="http://www.coolhunting.com/" target="_blank">coolhunting.com</a>

**What makes me love the design**:  
A clean, simple, and uncluttered navigation makes the site extremely easy to move through and find cool stuff. Large font sizes immediately let me recognize where I’m at on the site. The cards used to showcase different items feature large compelling imagery with great content hierarchy that allows me to easily scan through the content and find more.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/100/elevio.jpg" alt="Web design pick: Elev.io" /></div>

## Elevio

**Team member**: Justin McNally  
**URL**: <a href="https://www.elev.io/" target="_blank">elev.io</a>

**What makes me love the design**:  
I like how well it explains and demonstrates the product--along with the general materialistic, modern aesthetic.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/102/twitchtv.jpg" alt="Web design picks: Twitch.tv" /></div>

## Twitch

**Team member**: Tyler Bobella  
**URL**: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">twitch.tv</a>

**What makes me love the design**:  
I like how the site keeps things very simplistic in the sense that when you load the landing page, you are dropped into a live stream. Everything is segmented as you scroll down the page. There aren’t many graphics, or anything of that nature, but I think that is what I like about it. In my mind it gives more of the impression of “let our product talk for itself.”

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/103/fabric.jpg" alt="Web design pick: Fabric" /></div>

## Twitter / Fabric

**Team member**: Lawrence Davis  
**URL**: <a href="https://get.fabric.io/" target="_blank">get.fabric.io</a>

**What makes me love the design**:  
The pleasing color scheme, subtle yet eye-catching animations and parallax effects, as well as great uses of gifs and screenshots showcase product functionality.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/104/nytimes.jpg" alt="Web design pick: NY Times" /></div>

## New York Times “A Game of Shark and Minnow”

**Team member**: Maria Faulisi  
**URL**: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2013/10/27/south-china-sea/" target="_blank">nytimes.com</a>

**What makes me love the design**:  
I don’t have a favorite website per se, but this is one of the best examples of digital storytelling imo. The strong mix of long form read, videos, and maps enhance the story.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/105/momotaro.jpg" alt="Web design pick: Momotaro" /></div>

## Momotaro

**Team member**: Joslyn Brandt  
**URL**: <a href="http://www.momotarochicago.com" target="_blank">momotarochicago.com</a>

**What makes me love the design**:  
I like Momotarochicago.com because it’s visually pleasing, interesting, and colorful. The motion graphics make it more interactive while also being informative. It’s a very well done site.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/106/pinterest.jpg" alt="Web design pick: Pinterest" /></div>

## Pinterest

**Team member**: Tyler Ferraro  
**URL**: <a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">pinterest.com</a>

**What makes me love the design**:  
I like the uneven grids of images, which combine to make a seamless feed. When Pinterest launched, the layout felt new and fresh in its simplicity. While the content lends itself to a bit of information overload, the large images and little text help keep it from becoming too complicated.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/107/canopy.jpg" alt="Web design pick: Canopy" /></div>

## Canopy

**Team member**: Gino Desruisseaux  
**URL**: <a href="https://www.canopy.co" target="_blank">canopy.co</a>

**What makes me love the design**:  
It's clean, easy-to-navigate, and the product imagery is presented very well without an inundation of information.

<div><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/mediocre-production/uploads/image/filename/108/bolt.jpg" alt="Web design pick: Misfit Bolt" /></div>

## Misfit Bolt
**Team member**: Andy Richardson  
**URL**: <a href="https://misfit.com/products/bolt" target="_blank">misfit.com/products/bolt</a>

**What makes me love the design**:  
It does a nice job of incorporating the function and design of the product into that of the page; the use of color and environmental effect really play into what the product is about.
