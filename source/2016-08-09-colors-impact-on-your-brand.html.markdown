Picking your company colors is an important decision--after all, it’s core to your corporate brand identity. Color is the first cue your visitors will get from your website, even before seeing images, reading copy, or hearing music. _(Pro Tip: Please don’t put music on your website.)_ Color helps recall memory and immediately makes website or app users feel a certain way. You should consider color usage as design element that makes users feel what you want them to feel. 

Here are some examples of colors and what feelings they evoke, along with some great examples of companies who use these colors successfully in web design.


## White
While not technically a color, white is often associated with being “clean”--if a client asks for a “clean” website, we usually start by designing a website with a stark white background or a sleek black one.

## Black
Black brings a feeling of mystery, power, luxury, and sophistication when used in website design. It’s also commonly used as a background for simplistic websites.

##Blue
Blue is often used to indicate trust when it is chosen as a brand color. It’s also a color used to evoke stability, wisdom, faith, and truth. Considered a very calming color, it’s used frequently in the financial space to help customers feel as though they can trust a company with their money or security.
